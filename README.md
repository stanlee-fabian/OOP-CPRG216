## Object Oriented Programming using Python | Projects, Codes, Sample Runs and Outputs

## Description
The course explores the use of computer programming languages as tools that can be used to provide IT business solutions. I explored the evolution of computer programming and examine common problem-solving techniques. I also examined code reuse in functions, scoping and abstraction. The course includes an introduction to version control, and I utilized use classes and object-oriented programming principles to create applications using an industry-standard programming language. 

I worked alongside Thu Duong Nguyen to produce the projects together. 
The outputs posted have been verified and graded by Mr. Ahmad Almasri Winter 2024 Semester.
